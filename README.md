Project Name and Description
Start your README with a clear project name and a brief description of what your application does. For example:

# Product Catalog API

This Spring Boot application manages a simple product catalog through a RESTful API. It allows CRUD operations for products and integrates with external APIs to fetch and update product prices.

Installation and Setup
Provide instructions on how to set up and run your Spring Boot application locally. Include details about prerequisites (e.g., Java, Maven), how to clone the repository, and any environment variables needed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Java 11 and Maven installed.
3. Run the application.
4. Access the API at http://localhost:8080/products.

Usage
Explain how to use your application. Include examples of API endpoints (if applicable), how to run tests, and any other relevant details. If your project has a web interface, provide screenshots or GIFs to showcase its functionality.

## API Endpoints

- GET /products: Retrieve a list of products.
- GET /products/{id}: Retrieve a specific product by ID.
- POST /products: Create a new product.
- PUT /products/{id}: Update an existing product by ID.
- DELETE /products/{id}: Delete a product by ID.

Configuration
If your application requires configuration (e.g., database connection details, API keys), explain how users can configure it. Mention any configuration files or environment variables.

Contributing
Encourage contributions from others! Explain how users can contribute to your project—whether it’s reporting issues, suggesting improvements, or submitting pull requests.

License
Specify the license under which your project is released. Common licenses include MIT, Apache, and GPL. Include a license badge (you can generate one using shields.io).

Acknowledgments
If your project uses third-party libraries, APIs, or tools, acknowledge them. Mention any inspiration or references that helped you build your application.

Remember to keep your README concise, organized, and easy to read. Use Markdown syntax for formatting—it’s widely supported and makes your README more visually appealing.
